# PiServerPanel
Arcade Button with self wired RGB led and Metal Emergency Switch

This project started with an arcade button and the wish for an RGB led inside.
An emergency switch and the idea of some kind of "panel" f√ºr my raspberry pi was born.

Please note, there is a picture to visualize the components and simple wiring used.
